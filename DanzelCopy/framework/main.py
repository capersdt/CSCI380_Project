# NOTE: This demonstrates the Model-View-Controller architecture.
# It consists of four files - this (main.py), view.py, controller.py,
# and model.py .

# import modules
 
# NOTE: In most event-driven applications, the display - defined in view -
# creates all necessary functionality (to be driven by user events). 
# Thus, we only need to import the view module below.  However, for completeness
# (and self-documentation), we import everything.

from model import *
from view import *
from controller import *

# do whatever else needs to be done (if anything)
